# bootstrap4-to-5-migrator

A script to migrate from Bootstrap 4 to Bootstrap 5

To run the script:

`./migrate-bs4-to-bs5.sh <folder>`

This is far from perfect, some classes are missing, some classes are custom and won't apply to your case, creates double spaces at times.

Feel free to modify and PR.
